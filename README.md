This is my BTP project on Sparse Adaptive System Algorithms for Bilinear systems
Relevant reference papers on What a Bilinear system is attached in the BTP_ReferencePapers folder
As to what Adaptive System Algorithms are, One can see this lecture series from nptel : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEE3BA3C8CB606B8C
If the above series is too long ( watch this instead of a netflix series  :-| ), Watch this for a basic understanding of what they are : https://youtu.be/kXJ_WQlweiI
